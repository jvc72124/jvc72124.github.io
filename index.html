	<h3>Where to Stay and Where to Eat</h3>
	<P> Spain is a very large country with tons of things to see and do. To help you plan your trip to Spain, I have selected the best hotels and restaurant for the most popular and beautiful towns and cities in Spain. I hope this will be a helpful tool in planning your trip to Spain. I decided not to select the most high end or popular places, but instead some of the most unique and interesting places. I believe that when you visit a country, it is very important to immerse yourself in the culture, not just view the country as an outsider. You can gain so much more knowledge and have a much better understanding  of the country and those who live in it if you go to the right places and have an open mind during your travels. I hope the links in the table below help you plan an incredible vacation to the incredible country of Spain. </P>
